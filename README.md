# MachineLearning_coursework2
Coursework Task
Imagine that you work for an AI company, you are asked to develop a machine learning product that can
classify images. You will design a neural network for this image classification task. To complete this task,
you are suggested to follow the instructions below.
1. Find an appropriate public image dataset. The dataset should contain images (or pixels) with their
associated labels/classes. You can use any image dataset (e.g., animal images, flower images, etc.)
except for the digits image dataset in lab solutions. You can look for the dataset on any public data
website and here is just an example: https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?task=image-classification
2. Import the data to your program. Define the input and output. Split the data into training and testing
datasets.
3. Design a neural network for this image classification task. Your neural network should at least have
input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. Please feel free to add other layers and design your own
neural network structure.
4. Build the neural network using training dataset and evaluate it using testing dataset. Present the
evaluation result (e.g., accuracy).
5. Explain the training process and the model structure in a simple clear way. Please feel free to use
plot or flowchart.
6. Q & A section for general understanding: Answer two types of questions: one type about the Python
code used in your work, and the other type about content mentioned in lectures and seminars. Please
note you will be marked as NOT PASS if you fail to answer both questions.
7. [Optional] Preprocess the data to analyse the data set and to address data imbalance or quality if
there is any.
8. [Optional] Use other pre-trained models to improve the performance
9. [Optional] Develop any other additional feature you want.

Submission Requirement
You should submit the codes with your name and ID number. The file should contain one page of
documentation to analyse and discuss the work and the explanation of your implementation (comment
your code).
You will also need to present your work in the following two ways:
a. Present to a tutor during lab session within two weeks after the due date.
b. Record your screen while running the codes and include the video link WITHIN your
submission. The video should be less than 10 minutes and highlight the key features you
implemented.
